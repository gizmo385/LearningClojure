Clojure Experiments
===============

Various experiments with Clojure that may or may not get finished. These projects may or may not get
finished and there is no assurance that they will be finished in any reasonable time frame.

The projects currently included in the master branch are as follows:

* [automata](./automata): This is an experiment involving the simulation of finite state automata.

* [chat-app](./chat-app): An attempt at writing a distributed chat application. This operates on
  a similar message protocol that [this project](http://github.com/gizmo385/distributed-chat)
  operates on.

* [graphs](./graphs): Experiments in how to represent a semi-complex data structure in Clojure.
  Several different versions, included a typed version, are available in this repo.

* [n-bodies](./n-bodies): Attempting to create an n-body simulation in a stateless system. The logic
  behind this system is a port of [this project](https://github.com/gizmo385/n-bodies).

* [ttt-server](./ttt-server): Experiments in how a REST API might be defined in a language like
  Clojure.
